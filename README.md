# Spiritual Sundays Website

## Setup Instructions

### Files Included:
1. **index-separated.html** - Main HTML file
2. **style.css** - Stylesheet
3. **script.js** - JavaScript functionality
4. **Slide_1.png through Slide_14.png** - Guest slides
5. **S1.png through S6.png** - Speaker slides

### How to Use:

#### Option 1: Local Setup (Recommended for VS Code)
1. Create a new folder on your computer (e.g., "spiritual-sundays")
2. Download ALL files from the outputs folder
3. Place all files in the same folder:
   ```
   spiritual-sundays/
   ├── index-separated.html
   ├── style.css
   ├── script.js
   ├── Slide_1.png
   ├── Slide_2.png
   ├── ... (all other slides)
   ├── S1.png
   ├── S2.png
   └── ... (all other S files)
   ```
4. Open the folder in VS Code
5. Right-click on `index-separated.html` and select "Open with Live Server" (if you have the Live Server extension)
   - OR simply double-click the HTML file to open it in your browser

#### Option 2: Using the Full Path Version
- Use the original `index.html` file which has the full paths to the images already set

### Troubleshooting:

**If images don't appear:**
1. Make sure ALL image files are in the same folder as the HTML file
2. Check that the file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. If using VS Code, use the Live Server extension for proper file serving
4. Check the browser console (F12) for any error messages

**File Structure Check:**
All files must be in the same directory. You can verify this by opening the folder and seeing all files together.
